    <h1>How to Make Your Own Public Web Site</h1>

    <p class="warning">If you are under 18, please ask your parents before setting up your own web site!</p>

    <p class="warning">Disclaimer: I do not endorse, nor am I affiliated with, any of the products or services mentioned here.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This page was created primarily for people who have learned HTML/CSS and possibly JavaScript+Processing.js on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>. Users there are constantly asking "how do I create a real web site?" Khan Academy only provides a sandbox for educational purposes, not web site hosting services. This guide will explain how to use other services to create a web site that anyone on the Internet can browse.</p>

    <h2>What Should I Have Learned Before Proceeding?</h2>

    <p>You should have completed at least the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages</a> lessons on Khan Academy. This is the absolute minimum level of knowledge required.</p>

    <p>These <strong>optional</strong> lessons will also be useful to you, but it is not necessary to complete them before continuing here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Intro to JS: Drawing &amp; Animation</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js">HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-js-jquery">HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive with jQuery</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How am I going to do this? How much does it cost?</h2>

    <p>These instructions will describe how to set up a very simple static web site using the cloud file storage service <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox.com</a> and the web hosting service <a href="https://www.kissr.com/">KISSr</a>. This is free for a basic level of service.</p>

    <p>Dropbox will give you 2GB of cloud storage for free, and KISSr will let you set up one site that provides 1,000 web requests per month for free. This is plenty to get started with.</p>

    <p>This page was set up using the exact instructions described here.</p>

    <h2>Site Setup for HTML/CSS/JS</h2>
    <p class="text">Here's how you can make your own simple static web site that anyone can browse. Anything you learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will work in this environment. <strong>SQL is not supported.</strong></p>
    <ol>

        <li><strong>Create a Dropbox Account.</strong> This will provide storage space for your web site, and you can use it for other purposes as well. If you already have a Dropbox account, you can skip this part since you can use your existing Dropbox
            account with KISSr.
            <ol>
                <li>Create an account on <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox.com</a></li>
                <li>Install the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/install">Dropbox Software</a> on your computer. The Dropbox software automatically syncs the Dropbox folder on your computer to your Dropbox account. Therefore, you won't have to do any
                    manual file uploads. Make sure to use the software to log in with your DropBox account after installing it.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Log in to <a href="https://www.kissr.com/">KISSr</a> using your DropBox account.</strong> This will not disclose your Dropbox password to KISSr.</li>

        <li><strong>Create your subdomain</strong> of the form: <span class="code">yoursitename.kissr.com</span> where <span class="code">yoursitename</span> is replaced with a name you choose. Pick something good because you can't easily change it once you start using it.</li>

        <li><strong>Download and install <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a></strong>, a free HTML editor that's really good. You might also like <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>. You can use any HTML editor, so feel free to use another one if you can find a better one, but for the rest of this tutorial I will assume you are using one of those. Your editor doesn't need any special upload capability because you're just going to edit your site locally and Dropbox Sync will automatically upload your changes to your Dropbox storage.</li>

        <li>In Brackets, or whatever HTML editor you are using, use <strong>File-&gt;Open Folder</strong> and open up the <strong>Dropbox\Apps\KISSr</strong> folder on your local hard drive.</li>

        <li>Now, in Brackets in the sidebar on the left that says "Working Files" at the top, you will see a domain name like <span class="code">yoursitename.kissr.com</span> or whatever you named your domain name when you set up KISSr. Click on that, it will open, and you will see an <span class="code">index.html</span> file. Click the index.html to start editing. You can put other html and image files in this directory too.</li>

        <li><strong>To upload images</strong>, open a File Browser (File Explorer or Finder) window on your computer, go to the <span class="code">Dropbox\Apps\KISSr\yoursitename.kissr.com</span> folder and just drag them in there.<br>
        <strong>TIP:</strong> I strongly recommend creating a subdirectory called <span class="code">img</span> or something similar and placing all your images in there. That will help keep things from getting so cluttered.</li>

        <li><strong>You are now done with setup!</strong> Now all you have to do is create your site, using your HTML and CSS skills, and tell people about it.</li>

    </ol>


    <h2>Setup for Running Processing.js Programs from Khan Academy</h2>

    <h3>Processing.js Template</h3>

    <p>The main thing you need is the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/processingjs-inside-webpages-template/5157014494511104">Processing.js Template</a> from the Khan Academy web site.</p>
    <p>Just copy the necessary parts of the template to your HTML file and replace this entire part:</p>
    <div class="code">
    // ProgramCodeGoesHere
    fill(255, 255, 0);
    ellipse(200, 200, 200, 200);
    noFill();
    stroke(0, 0, 0);
    strokeWeight(2);
    arc(200, 200, 150, 100, 0, PI);
    fill(0, 0, 0);
    ellipse(250, 200, 10, 10);
    ellipse(153, 200, 10, 10);
</div>

    <p>With your own code. Put the &lt;canvas&gt; tag wherever you want the program's canvas to appear. There is an example program below so you can see how it works. You can also use <strong>View Source</strong> in your browser to view the HTML of this page to see how I created it.</p>

    <div class="canvas">
        <!--This draws the ProcessigJS Canvas on the web page -->
        <canvas id="mycanvas"></canvas><br> This is <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-paint-splatter/5316498611372032">Paint Splatter</a> from Khan Academy.
    </div>


    <p>You can CSS style the canvas tag to control the placement and margin of the canvas. If you want a different canvas size or frame rate, change the numbers in this part of the code:</p>
<div class="code">
    with (processingInstance) {
        size(400, 400);
        frameRate(30);
</div>

    <h3>Differences Between Khan Academy's Processing.js and the Standard Version</h3>

    <p><strong>The good news:</strong> You can now use some Processing.js functions and JavaScript features that don't work on Khan Academy! See the following documentation for all the cool stuff you can do now:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://processingjs.org/reference/">Processing.js Reference</a> for the full list of Processing.js functions.</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript Reference</a> (ECMAScript 5.1)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The bad news:</strong> You might need to make some minor code changes to get your code working outside of KA. <a href="https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202260404-What-parts-of-ProcessingJS-does-Khan-Academy-support-">See here</a> for some differences between KA and the standard Processing.js library.</p>

    <p><strong>There is no "Oh noes! the error buddy" on real web pages!</strong> The training wheels are off now, but the good news is you are in the same browser environment as professional web developers. To see errors, look for the <strong>JavaScript Console</strong> in your browser window. On my browser it is under <strong>Tools-&gt;Web Developer-&gt;Web Console.</strong></p>


    <h1>What do I do next?</h1>

    <p>For now you should focus on getting really confortable creating your own site with the static web server environment described above, especially if you are still in middle school but eventually you may want to get more advanced. Here are some suggestions on what to do and learn next.</p>


    <h2>Intermediate Difficulty Level</h2>

    <p>This is where things start to get more difficult, but you don't need to be a professional web developer yet.</p>

    <h3>Read the Full HTML/CSS Reference</h3>

    <p>You haven't learned everything yet. Read over, or at least poke around in, the reference documentation to see just how many things you can do with HTML and CSS:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Full <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">HTML5 Element Reference</a></li>
        <li>Full <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp">CSS3 Reference</a></li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Learn More JavaScript</h3>

    <p>If you have not done these Khan Academy tutorials yet then do these before continuing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Intro to JS: Drawing &amp; Animation</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js">HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-js-jquery">HTML/JS: Making webpages interactibe with jQuery</a></li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Consider Using GitPages</h3>

    <p>KISSr limits your usage to 1,000 page views per month with the free account. While you can pay them $5/month to remove this restriction and gain the ability to create as many subdomains as you want, you might want to try using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitPages</a> which doesn't have usage limitations.</p>

    <p>GitPages is slightly harder to use because you will need to learn to use <a href="https://github.com/">Git</a> to upload your files.</p>

    <p>While you can just upload files to a Git project using your web browser, you're strongly advised to learn how to use Git because this knowledge will come in very handy for the more advanced server hosting environments described below. I recommend learning to at least use the GUI Git client provided by GitHub.</p>

    <p>GitPages has the limitation that you can only have one site per user or Git project. Also, <strong>everything you upload there is public to the world unless you pay a subscription fee.</strong> So be warned about that.</p>


    <h3>Get a Free Cpanel and LAMP-Based Web Hosting Account</h3>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a> stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/php7/index.htm">PHP</a>. While PHP is a bit "old school" at this point (it was one of the first server-side scripting languages) it's one of the few languages supported for scripting on free web hosting accounts.</p>

    <p>Here are two major web hosting providers that provide free accounts of this type:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://x10hosting.com">X10 Hosting</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://000webhost.com">000Webhost.com</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are plenty of others that you can find by searching around. All of them provide PHP and SQL-based database servers. Files are typically uploaded using an FTP client or via your web browser. (Few have Git support.) The only major disadvantage is that the only server-side scripting language they usually support is PHP which you can <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/php7/index.htm">learn here at tutorialspoint</a>.</p>

    <p>You can also use these to serve static HTML pages with no PHP. So they may be a better alternative to using GitPages.</p>


    <h3>Learn Server-Side Scripting</h3>

    <p>Learn server-side scripting with <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/php7/index.htm">PHP</a>, or another server-side scripting language. Why? Because for many purposes you need to be able to write server-side code. This is especially true if you need to store information in a database.</p>

    <p>You can learn Node.js and Express.js at <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/index.htm">tutorialspoint</a>.</p>

    <p>There are other server-side scripting environments you can use that are based on python, ruby, and other languages. Tutorialspoint has tutorials for all of them.</p>


    <h3>Other Code Practice Sandboxes and Playgrounds</h3>

    <p>Here are some sites where you can play around with JavaScript and even experiment with server-side scripting:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://hyperdev.com/">HyperDev</a> supports <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a> and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> for server side scripting! (Recommended)</strong></li>
        <li><a href="http://codepen.io/pen/">Codepen</a> is client-side only but supports Angular.JS, jQuery, and other JS libraries.</li>
        <li><a href="http://jsbin.com">JSBin</a> is similar to Codepen in capability.</li>
        <li><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a> is similar to the previous two but has Processing.js as a library option.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Expert Difficulty Level</h2>

    <p><strong>This section is very advanced, so be prepared to learn a lot of stuff if you want to do any of this.</strong></p>

    <p>Once you get to this point, you are getting into the realm of professional web application development. You should know what server-side scripting is, what databases are, and have at least tinkered with these things.</p>

    <p>Before continuing, you should learn how to use <strong>command line interfaces</strong> (CLIs), also called command shells. Which one you use will depend on which operating systems you are using. Web servers most frequently use Linux, so you will need to learn that no matter what. Fortunately for Mac users, OS X uses essentially the same command line interface as Linux with a few minor differences. Windows is a little different since PowerShell is now the preferred CLI, but you can install <span class="code">bash</span> or another Unix/Linux style shell in Windows if you want.</p>

    <p>Here are some resources that will help:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line">Learn to use the shell command line</a> on CodeAcademy. This tutorial is interactive and will teach you to use Unix/Linux style command line shells even if you know nothing.</li>
        <li><a href="https://blog.udemy.com/powershell-tutorial/">A Beginner’s Introduction to Windows PowerShell</a> for those using Windows. If you are not using Windows you can skip this.</li>
        <li>You can skip learning PowerShell by <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/">installing Linux bash on Windows</a> after which you will have the same sort of command line interface
            in Windows that you do elsewhere.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Install Node.js and a Database Server on Your Desktop or Laptop</h3>

    <p>You can install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer, run applications from the command line, and use your browser to view them. This is useful for developing and testing your code offline until you're ready to deploy (upload) it.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to install Apache, PHP, python, ruby, and other languages with web application frameworks on your local computer for purposes of learning and testing.</p>

    <p>You can also install a database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL on your local computer. Both of these come with GUI management tools.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a></li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Get a Free Containerized Cloud Hosting Account at Heroku</h3>

    <p>Now that you know the CLI and know some things about both server-side scripting and databases, you might want to try out containerized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Service_models">cloud computing</a> services. There is one that allows you to use Node.js and PostgreSQL for free called <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and it looks pretty impressive considering what you can do for free.</p>

    <p>You will need to know how to use the CLI on your local computer because it's pretty much impossible to use Heroku without the CLI, but they have excellent step-by-step tutorials on how to deploy and manage applications on their service. You will also need to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git">learn to use Git from the command line</a>.</p>

    <p>Heroku is a <strong>PaaS</strong> (Platform as a Service) type service which doesn't offer you true virtual machines like an <strong>IaaS</strong> (Infrastructure as a Service) type service. So don't expect to be able to upload your own virtual machine images.</p>


    <h3>Experiment With Local Virtual Servers</h3>

    <p>You can simulate an IaaS cloud hosting server on your local computer using free virtual machine software. This is helpful because it gets you used to using a virtual server the same way you would using a virtual server hosting service.</p>

    <p>Download <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> (Virtual Machine hypervisor) and run a <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/mean/virtual-machine">virtual machine image</a> installed with <a href="http://meanjs.org/">MEAN.JS</a> for example. There are a lot of other <a href="https://bitnami.com/stacks">virtual machine images</a> that you can experiment with.</p>

    <p>Once you have a virtual machine running, you will want to treat it like some virtual machine that's running on an unknown rack mount server in some unknown location where you will never see it, because this is the situation with actual virtual machine hosting services. In other words, you want to treat your VM like a "headless" machine (one with no monitor or keyboard).</p>

    <p>To access and control your VM, you will <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/beginners-guide-setting-ssh-linux-testing-setup/">need to use ssh</a> which is a way to get a command line on remote computers and upload files. Hopefully your VM has Git installed on it, and the best practice for uploading changes to a site or web application is to use Git.</p>


    <h3>Virtual Web Server Hosting</h3>

    <p>Once you're familiar with virtual machine servers, you might want to create your own web site based on one and possibly run other types of servers on it such as game servers.</p>

    <p><strong>This is very advanced, so you will need to learn a lot about system administration and web devlopment before you can make good use of an environment like this. Get comfortable with running a virtual server on your own computer first.</strong> Here are some recommendations.</p>

    <p>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/one-click-apps/lamp/">virtual server hosting account</a> running a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a> (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) installation will do pretty much anything that one could want, but it isn't much different than the free LAMP-based web hosting accounts mentioned above. The main advantage is that you will have command line access and can do whatever you want with the virtual server.</p>

    <p>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/one-click-apps/mean/">virtual server hosting account</a> running <a href="http://meanjs.org/">MEAN.JS</a> provides an environment with <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/">MongoDB</a> and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> plus <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a> for server-side scripting. This is a little more sophisticated than the previous option but it entirely uses JavaScript so learning PHP isn't necessary. Learning the JavaScript frameworks (Express.js, Node.js, and Angular.js) is necessary though, and you can learn more about some of those on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">CodeAcademy</a>. You can experiment with Node.JS and Express.JS at <a href="https://hyperdev.com/">HyperDev</a>.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind virtual servers are an advanced topic and you want to be very comfortable with creating static web sites before delving into virtual servers, server-side scripting, and databases! These are hard core professional level environments.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>If you've made it this far and managed to at lest tinker with everything mentioned here then congratulations! But you're still not a professional web developer just yet. There's stil quite a bit to learn about things like user interaction, usability, software engineering practices, and application design. But hopefully all of this has at least gotten you started toward crating the next killer web app.</p>
