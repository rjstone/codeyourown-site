    <h1>How to Make Your Own Public Web Site</h1>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This page was created primarily for people who have learned HTML/CSS and possibly JavaScript+Processing.js on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>. Users there are constantly asking "how do I create a real web site?" Khan Academy only provides a sandbox for educational purposes, not web site hosting services. This guide will explain how to use other services to create a web site that anyone on the Internet can browse.</p>

    <p class="warning">If you are under 18, please ask your parents before setting up your own web site!</p>

    <p class="warning">Disclaimer: The author does not endorse, nor is he affiliated with, any of the products or services mentioned here.</p>

    <p>This page was set up using the exact instructions described here.</p>

    <h2>What Should I Have Learned Before Proceeding?</h2>

    <p>You should have completed at least the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages</a> lessons on Khan Academy. This is the absolute minimum level of knowledge required.</p>

    <p>These <strong>optional</strong> lessons will also be useful to you, but it is not necessary to complete them before continuing here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Intro to JS: Drawing &amp; Animation</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js">HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-js-jquery">HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive with jQuery</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How does this work? How much does it cost?</h2>

    <p>These instructions will describe how to set up a very simple static web site using the cloud file storage service <a href="https://db.tt/JBhh3niM">Dropbox.com</a> and the web hosting service <a href="https://www.kissr.com/">KISSr</a>. Both are free for a basic level of service.</p>

    <p>Dropbox will give you 2GB of cloud storage for free, and KISSr will let you set up one site that provides 1,000 web requests per month for free. This is plenty to get started with.</p>

    <h2>Site Setup for HTML/CSS/JS</h2>
    <p>Below are the instructions for setting up your static web site. A static web site is the simplest type of web site. There are no scripts or SQL databases running on the server. This means that <strong>SQL is not supported</strong> on this type of site.</p>
    <p>Anything you have learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will work in this environment. You can write JavaScript that will work in the browser of anyone visiting your site.</p>

    <div class="step-reset">

        <h3 class="step">Create a Dropbox Account</h3>
        <p>First, you will need a Dropbox account. This will provide network storage space for your web site, and you can use it for storing other files too. If you already have a Dropbox account, you can skip this part since you can use your existing Dropbox account with KISSr.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create an account on <a href="https://db.tt/JBhh3niM">Dropbox.com</a> - Please use <a href="https://db.tt/JBhh3niM">this link</a> to help the author of this guide. That way he will get referral credit.</li>
            <li>Install the <a href="https://db.tt/JBhh3niM">Dropbox Software</a> on your computer. The Dropbox software automatically syncs the Dropbox folder on your computer to your Dropbox account. This means you won't have to manually upload files.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here is a video about how to install Dropbox if you need help, but it is not very difficult.</p>

        <div class="video">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zAsye_RDnAg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3 class="step">Log in to KISSr</h3>
        <p>Log in to <a href="https://www.kissr.com/">KISSr</a> using your Dropbox account. This will not disclose your Dropbox password to KISSr.</p>

        <p>Create your subdomain of the form: <span class="code">yoursitename.kissr.com</span> where <span class="code">yoursitename</span> is replaced with a name you choose. Pick something good because you can't easily change it once you tell everyone about it.</p>

        <h3 class="step">Download and Install a Code Editor</h3>
        <p>To edit the code for your site, you will need a text editor. Using a <strong>code editor</strong>, a type of text editor that is designed with HTML and other code editing in mind, is essential. Here are some options which range from easiest to more difficult. All of these are free.</p>
        <ul>
             <li><a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> is the easiest choice. It comes with many good features, such as a color picker, and good default settings for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
             <li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> has different features and is a little more complicated.</li>
             <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> is similar, but it is somewhat more advanced and more difficult to use.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can use any text editor, even Windows Notepad or OS X TextEdit, but the rest of this tutorial will assume you are using one of the code editors listed above. Your editor doesn't need any special file upload features because you're just going to edit your files locally and Dropbox Sync will automatically upload your changes to your Dropbox storage. Once uploaded to Dropbox, your files automatically become available to the web server.</p>

        <p>Here is a beginner's level video about the Brackets code editor.</p>
        <div class="video">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GN0txxeT46A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3 class="step">Launch the Editor and Open Your Site Folder</h3>
        <p>Launch your editor, use the <strong>File-&gt;Open Folder</strong> menu option, then navigate to the <span class="code">Dropbox\Apps\KISSr</span> folder on your local hard drive. Select the folder inside that has the same name as your web site and click the <strong>Open</strong> button.</p>

        <h3 class="step">Edit Your index.html File</h3>
        <p>The <span class="code">index.html</span> file is the main page on your site. In your editor in the sidebar on the left, you will see the <span class="code">index.html</span> file. Click on it to start editing. You can put other html files in the same directory, or create them from within the editor and save them in your site directory, and they will show up here.</p>

        <p>Changes you make to the file, or any other files, will not be available on your web site until 1) you save the file and 2) Dropbox Sync has a few seconds to upload the file. Small files like text files sync very quickly so it will probably happen too fast for you to notice. If you have any problems, check the Dropbox status icon to see if there are any warnings or error messages.</p>

        <h3 class="step">Verify Operation</h3>

        <p>Now that you've made some sort of change to your <span class="code">index.html</span> file, load your new site in your browser to see if it's working. By now you have probably figured out that the URL will be <span class="code">http://yoursitename.kissr.com/</span> where <span class="code">yoursitename</span> is the subdomain name you used.</p>

        <p>You don't need to put a filename at the end of the URL. This is because <span class="code">index.html</span> is a special filename that the server knows to look for when a specific filename is not in the URL. Any other files in the same directory will need to have their filename specified in the URL.</p>

        <p>If you create a subdirectory in your site folder then you can put an <span class="code">index.html</span> file in the subdirectory, and it will return that file if someone uses the URL <span class="code">http://yoursiename.kissr.com/subdir/</span> where "subdir" is the name of the directory. Practically every single web server works ths way, so you can assume this works on any web server.</p>

        <p>Notice that when you make changes to an HTML file you will need to use the page reload button on your web browser before they become visible.</p>

        <p><strong>TIP:</strong> You can also just double-click on an html file from a file browser window on your desktop and this will load the file into your browser from the local hard drive. This is a good way of checking your code more quickly when you are editing it. The code editors mentioned above also have functions or extensions that will do this for you automatically every time you save a file.</p>

        <h3 class="step">Upload Images for Your Site (optional)</h3>
        <p>To upload images, open a file browser window (File Explorer in Windows or Finder in OS X) on your desktop, go to the <span class="code">Dropbox\Apps\KISSr\yoursitename.kissr.com</span> folder and just copy your images in there.</p>

        <p>It is strongly recommended that you create a subdirectory called <span class="code">img</span> in your site folder and place all images in there. That will help prevent your site folder from getting too messy.</p>

        <p>Once your image or images have been uploaded, you can use them with a tag like:<br /><span class="code">&lt;img src="img/myimage.jpg"&gt;</span>.</p>

        <h3 class="step">Create Your Site Content</h3>

        <p>You are now done with the initial setup of your new web site! Now all you have to do is keep creating your site content using your HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript skills. Don't forget to tell tell everyone about it.</p>

        <h3 class="step">Register a Domain Name (optional)</h3>

        <p>This is completely optional and it's the only thing here that costs money, but some domains are extremely cheap (less than US$1/year).</p>

        <p>If you don't like the domain name <span class="code">kissr.com</span> (most people wouldn't blame you) you can register your own domain name. <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/domains.aspx">NameCheap</a> lives up to its name and will register some domains for less than US$1 per year. There is no reason why you have to use them though because there are hundreds of companies that handle domain registration. See the botton of <a href="https://www.kissr.com/pages/documentation">this page</a> for a list, or just do a web search for "domain registration".</p>

        <p>Once you have registered a domain name, you will need to point a DNS record to the web server. Instructions on how to do that are <a href="https://www.kissr.com/pages/documentation">available here</a>.</p>

        <p>Domain names are useful not just because you can pick your own name, but also because they allow you to move your site to a different server without changing the URL. So if you later decide to move your site to a web server with more features, all you will need to do is update the DNS record for the domain to point to the new server. Nobody will even notice that you moved your site to a different service because the URL for your site will stay the same.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Oh Noes! Where is Oh Noes! the Error Buddy?</h2>

    <p>He needs some rest and is sitting this one out. Actually, there is no "Oh noes! the error buddy" in a standard web browser environment!</p>

    <p>The training wheels are off now, but the good news is you are in the same browser environment as professional web developers. To see errors, look for the <strong>JavaScript Console</strong> in your browser menus. On Firefox it is under <strong>Tools-&gt;Web Developer-&gt;Web Console.</strong> For this option to appear in the menus you may need to enable developer or debugging options in your browser configuration depending on which browser you are using.</p>

    <p>The code editors mentioned above also have syntax checking features that can warn you of some types of errors as soon as you type them. Read the manual for your code editor to find out more about these. You may need to download and install extension packages to get some of these features.</p>

    <h2>Running Processing.js Programs from Khan Academy on Your Site</h2>

    <p>This part is optional. It only applies if you have created your own programs using JavaScript+Processing.js on Khan Academy and want to embed them in your site's pages.</p>

    <h3>Khan Academy Processing.js Template</h3>

    <p>You can use your programs from Khan Academy on your own web site, but you will need to add a little extra code to them to make them work. The main thing you need is the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/processingjs-inside-webpages-template/5157014494511104">Processing.js Template</a> from the Khan Academy web site. Here is a stripped-down version of it with the important parts:</p>
<div class="code">
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!--Place the canvas element where you want the canvas to appear --&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="mycanvas"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;!-- This causes the browser to loead the Processing.js library --&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/processing.js/1.4.8/processing.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    var sketchProc = function(processingInstance) {
        with (processingInstance) {
            size(400, 400);
            frameRate(30);

            // YOUR CODE STARTS HERE

            /***** Replace this line with your code from KA. *****/

            // YOUR CODE ENDS HERE
        }};
    var canvas = document.getElementById("mycanvas");
    var processingInstance = new Processing(canvas, sketchProc);
&lt;/script&gt;
</div>

    <p>Just copy the needed parts of this snippet to your HTML file and replace the indicated comment line with your code.</p>

    <p>Put the <strong>&lt;canvas&gt;</strong> tag wherever you want the program's canvas to appear. There is an example program below so you can see what it will look like. If it helps any, you can also use the <strong>View Page Source</strong> function in your browser to view the HTML of this page to see how it is coded.</p>

    <div class="canvas">
        <!--This draws the ProcessigJS Canvas on the web page -->
        <canvas id="mycanvas"></canvas><br>This is <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-paint-splatter/5316498611372032">Paint Splatter</a> from Khan Academy.
    </div>

    <p>You can CSS style the <strong>&lt;canvas&gt;</strong> element to control things like the placement and margin of the canvas. If you want a different canvas size or frame rate, change the numbers in this part of the code:</p>
<div class="code">
    ...
    with (processingInstance) {
        size(400, 400);
        frameRate(30);
    ...
</div>

    <h3>Differences Between Khan Academy's Processing.js and the Standard Version</h3>

    <p>There are some differences between the Processing.js library used by Khan Academy and the stanard one that you will be using on your own web pages.</p>

    <p><strong>The good news:</strong> You can now use some Processing.js functions and JavaScript features that don't work on Khan Academy! See the following documentation for all the cool stuff you can do now:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://processingjs.org/reference/">Processing.js Reference</a> for the full list of Processing.js functions.</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript Reference</a> (ECMAScript 5.1)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The bad news:</strong> You might need to make some minor code changes to get your code working outside of KA. Fortunately, this usually only means adding a line or two of code. <a href="https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202260404-What-parts-of-ProcessingJS-does-Khan-Academy-support-">See here</a> for some differences between KA and the standard Processing.js library.</p>


    <h1>What Should I Learn Next?</h1>

    <p>For now you should focus on getting really confortable creating your own site with the static web server environment described above, especially if you are still in middle school, but eventually you may want to get more advanced. Here are some suggestions on what to do and learn next.</p>

    <h3>Learn More JavaScript</h3>

    <p>If you have not done these Khan Academy tutorials yet then do these before continuing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Intro to JS: Drawing &amp; Animation</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js">HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-js-jquery">HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive with jQuery</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/internet-intro">Internet 101</a> - How the Internet works</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Intermediate Difficulty Level</h2>

    <p>This is where things start to get more difficult, but you don't need to be a professional web developer yet.</p>

    <p>Things at this level are recommended for people who are at least in high school.</p>


    <h3>Get Familiar With the Full HTML/CSS Reference</h3>

    <p>You haven't learned everything yet. Read over, or at least poke around in, the reference documentation to see just how many things you can do with HTML and CSS:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Full <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">HTML5 Element Reference</a></li>
        <li>Full <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp">CSS3 Reference</a></li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Consider Using GitPages</h3>

    <p>KISSr limits your usage to 1,000 page views per month with the free account. While you can pay them $5/month to remove this restriction and gain the ability to create as many subdomains as you want, you might want to try using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitPages</a> which doesn't have usage limitations.</p>

    <p>GitPages is slightly harder to use because you will need to learn to use <a href="https://github.com/">Git</a> to upload your files.</p>

    <p>While you can just upload files to a Git project using your web browser, learning Git is worthwhile because this knowledge will come in very handy for the more advanced server hosting environments described below. At first, at least learn to use the GUI Git client provided by GitHub.</p>

    <p>GitPages has the limitation that you can only have one domain name per user and it has to be your username. Also, <strong>everything you upload there is public to the world unless you pay a subscription fee.</strong> So be warned about that.</p>


    <h3>Learn Server-Side Scripting</h3>

    <p>Learn server-side scripting with <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/php7/index.htm">PHP</a>, or another server-side scripting language. Why? Because for many purposes you need to be able to write server-side code. This is especially true if you need to store information in a database.</p>

    <p>You can learn Node.js and Express.js at <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/index.htm">tutorialspoint</a>.</p>

    <p>There are other server-side scripting environments you can use that are based on python, ruby, and other languages. Tutorialspoint has tutorials for all of them.</p>


    <h3>Other Code Practice Sandboxes and Playgrounds</h3>

    <p>Here are some sites where you can play around with JavaScript and even experiment with server-side scripting:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://hyperdev.com/">HyperDev</a> supports <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a> and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> for server side scripting! (Recommended)</strong></li>
        <li><a href="http://codepen.io/pen/">Codepen</a> is client-side only but supports Angular.JS, jQuery, and other JS libraries.</li>
        <li><a href="http://jsbin.com">JSBin</a> is similar to Codepen in capability.</li>
        <li><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a> is similar to the previous two but has Processing.js as a library option.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Learn SQL</h3>

    <p>If you haven't already, learn SQL with the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql">Intro to SQL: Querying and managing data</a> lessons on Khan Academy.</p>

    <p>After learning that, you might want to install some free SQL relational database software on your own computer. The two most popular free and open source SQL relational databases are MySQL and PostgreSQL. Both of these come with installers and excellent GUI management tools.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a> - This one has a very good GUI management client with database schema design diagramming built in.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a></li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Get a Free Cpanel and LAMP-Based Web Hosting Account</h3>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a> stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/php7/index.htm">PHP</a>. Cpanel is a site management interface that is easier to use than a command line interface.</p>

    <p>While PHP is a bit "old school" at this point (it was one of the first server-side scripting languages) it's one of the few languages commonly supported for scripting on free web hosting accounts.</p>

    <p>This is the point where the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql">Intro to SQL: Querying and managing data</a> lessons on Khan Academy become useful, because now you will be able to use a database server with SQL.</p>

    <p>Here are two major web hosting providers that provide free accounts of this type:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://x10hosting.com">X10 Hosting</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://000webhost.com">000Webhost.com</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are plenty of others that you can find by searching around. All services of this type provide PHP scripting and SQL-based database servers. Files are typically uploaded using an FTP client or via your web browser. (Few have Git or ssh upload support.) The only major disadvantage is that usually the only server-side scripting language they support is PHP. You can <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/php7/index.htm">learn PHP here at tutorialspoint</a>.</p>

    <p>You can also use this type of free account to serve static HTML pages with no PHP or database usage. They may be a better alternative to using KISSr or GitPages, though it is more difficult to upload files to them.</p>


    <h2>Expert Difficulty Level</h2>

    <p><strong>This section is very advanced, so be prepared to learn a lot of stuff if you want to do any of this.</strong></p>

    <p>This section is recommended for college students or possibly some high school students who are hard-core computer geeks.</p>

    <p>Once you get to this point, you are getting into the realm of professional web application development. You should know what server-side scripting is, what databases are, and have at least tinkered with these things.</p>

    <p>Before continuing, you should learn how to use <strong>command line interfaces</strong> (CLIs), also called shells. Which one you use will depend on which operating systems you are using. Web servers most frequently use Linux, so you will need to learn that no matter what. Fortunately for Mac users, OS X uses essentially the same command line interface as Linux with a few minor differences. Windows is a little different since PowerShell is now the preferred CLI, but you can install <span class="code">bash</span> or another Unix/Linux style shell in Windows if you want.</p>

    <p>Here are some resources that will help:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line">Learn to use the shell command line</a> on CodeAcademy. This tutorial is interactive and will teach you to use Unix/Linux style command line shells, such as 'bash', even if you know nothing.</li>
        <li>If you installed <a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">Git for Windows</a>, you already have a Linux-like shell called "Git Bash" that you can launch from the start menu. Just type "git bash" into the search box of the start menu. You don't have to be using Git to use the 'bash' shell. You can do anything with it, and it comes already configured for running git commands too. It recognizes the same sort of commands as 'bash' on Linux, but it doesn't allow you to run Linux software.</li>
        <li><a href="https://blog.udemy.com/powershell-tutorial/">A Beginner’s Introduction to Windows PowerShell</a> for those using Windows.</li>
        <li>If you have Windows 10 and have installed the Anniversary Update, you can actualy <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/">install Microsoft's Linux command line environment on Windows</a>. This will not only give you a Linux shell, but you can also run actual Linux command line software. It is basically a Linux emulator, but it doesn't use a virtual machine and doesn't come with support for graphical applications by default.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Install Node.js and a Database Server on Your Desktop or Laptop</h3>

    <p>You can install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer, run applications from the command line, and use your browser to view them. This is useful for developing and testing your code offline until you're ready to deploy (upload) it.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to install Apache, PHP, python, ruby, and other languages with web application frameworks on your local computer for purposes of learning and testing.</p>

    <p>If you haven't already then you probably want to install a database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL on your local computer.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a> has a very good GUI management client with databae schema design diagramming built in. This is very useful for learning.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> is another very common full-featured relational database server. The GUI client isn't quite as fancy but it is still very good.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Get a Free Containerized Cloud Hosting Account at Heroku</h3>

    <p>Now that you know the CLI and know some things about both server-side scripting and databases, you might want to try out containerized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Service_models">cloud computing</a> services. There is one that allows you to use Node.js and PostgreSQL for free called <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and it looks pretty impressive considering what you can do for free.</p>

    <p>You will need to know how to use the CLI on your local computer because it's pretty much impossible to use Heroku without the CLI, but they have excellent step-by-step tutorials on how to deploy and manage applications on their service. You will also need to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git">learn to use Git from the command line</a>.</p>

    <p>Heroku is a <strong>PaaS</strong> (Platform as a Service) type service which doesn't offer you true virtual machines like an <strong>IaaS</strong> (Infrastructure as a Service) type service. So don't expect to be able to upload your own virtual machine images.</p>


    <h3>Experiment With Local Virtual Servers</h3>

    <p>You can simulate an IaaS cloud hosting server on your local computer using free virtual machine software. This is helpful because it gets you used to using a virtual server the same way you would using a virtual server hosting service.</p>

    <p>Download <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> (Virtual Machine hypervisor) and run a <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/mean/virtual-machine">virtual machine image</a> installed with <a href="http://meanjs.org/">MEAN.JS</a> for example. There are a lot of other <a href="https://bitnami.com/stacks">virtual machine images</a> that you can experiment with.</p>

    <p>Once you have a virtual machine running, you will want to treat it like some virtual machine that's running on an unknown rack mount server in some unknown location where you will never see it, because this is the situation with actual virtual machine hosting services. In other words, you want to treat your VM like a "headless" machine (one with no monitor or keyboard).</p>

    <p>To access and control your VM, you will <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/beginners-guide-setting-ssh-linux-testing-setup/">need to use ssh</a> which is a way to get a command line on remote computers and upload files. Hopefully your VM has Git installed on it, and the best practice for uploading changes to a site or web application is to use Git.</p>


    <h3>Virtual Web Server Hosting</h3>

    <p>Once you're familiar with virtual machine servers, you might want to create your own web site based on one and possibly run other types of servers on it such as game servers.</p>

    <p><strong>This is very advanced, so you will need to learn a lot about system administration and web devlopment before you can make good use of an environment like this. Get comfortable with running a virtual server on your own computer first.</strong> Here are some recommendations.</p>

    <p>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/one-click-apps/lamp/">virtual server hosting account</a> running a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a> (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) installation will do pretty much anything that one could want, but it isn't much different than the free LAMP-based web hosting accounts mentioned above. The main advantage is that you will have command line access and can do whatever you want with the virtual server.</p>

    <p>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/one-click-apps/mean/">virtual server hosting account</a> running <a href="http://meanjs.org/">MEAN.JS</a> provides an environment with <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/">MongoDB</a> and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> plus <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a> for server-side scripting. This is a little more sophisticated than the previous option but it entirely uses JavaScript so learning PHP isn't necessary. Learning the JavaScript frameworks (Express.js, Node.js, and Angular.js) is necessary though, and you can learn more about some of those on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">CodeAcademy</a>. You can experiment with Node.JS and Express.JS at <a href="https://hyperdev.com/">HyperDev</a>.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind virtual servers are an advanced topic and you want to be very comfortable with creating static web sites before delving into virtual servers, server-side scripting, and databases! These are hard core professional level environments.</p>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>If you've made it this far and managed to at least tinker with everything mentioned here then congratulations! But you're still not a professional web developer just yet. There's stil quite a bit to learn about things like user interaction, usability, software engineering practices, and application design. But hopefully all of this has at least gotten you started toward creating the next killer web app.</p>
